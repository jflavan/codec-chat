# Production voice services — mediasoup SFU + coturn TURN server.
# Deployed to /opt/voice/docker-compose.yml on the voice VM by CI/CD.
# CI/CD substitutes the ${...} variables before writing the file to the VM.
#
# Required substitutions (set as env vars before running envsubst):
#   ACR_SERVER        — e.g. acrcodecprod.azurecr.io
#   IMAGE_TAG         — Docker image tag (git SHA)
#   ANNOUNCED_IP      — VM's public IP address (for mediasoup ICE candidates)
#   TURN_SECRET       — HMAC-SHA256 shared secret for coturn time-limited credentials
#   SFU_INTERNAL_KEY  — shared secret checked by the SFU /rooms/* auth middleware
